FortyTwoBinary.com is a domain I purchased to represent my work outside of my employment as a software consultant.
I needed a domain to represent my open source initiative called VirtualYou. And, part of my dream is to build world-class
software but not just by myself. I didn't want to tie the development force to the current project either. This about 
page is here to explain what we're doing at FortyTwoBinary and also to explain why the name forty two binary or ten ten 
ten (101010).

We're preparing for a new organization on GitHub called FortyTwoBinary. The web page you're reading is being
hosted by Github in the public repository for GitHub pages for David L. Whitehurst. DNS records are currently pointing the 
fortytwobinary.com domain to the GitHub name servers. We'll move all this when the organization is formed and set up in 
Github. When you're done here, you should take a look at our mission statement.

The name FortyTwoBinary came about when I realized that 101010 was binary for the integer 42. And, it looks like ten ten 
ten. I married my high school sweetheart on October 10, 2010 or ten ten ten. So 42 binary makes me think of my wife,
and chief financial officer, Patricia Rigler Whitehurst.
