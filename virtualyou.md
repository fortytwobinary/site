Generally there is no magic answer when we unexpectedly need help with our personal affairs, nor is anything ever 
simple or quick. VirtualYou abstracts all the everyday tasks we take for granted and logically organizes your 
personal assets, financial liabilities, citizen responsibilities, and obligations to other people. VirtualYou 
also keeps those detail specifics and hard to remember things on hand so they are readily available anywhere. As 
we model ourselves in VirtualYou, we lessen the risk of overwhelming anyone that attempts to bring order to our 
affairs.

Better yet, using VirtualYou we are more prepared to hand over the management of responsibilities for our estate 
before or after our passing. Spouses or children can greatly help us with anything as long as we have our 
instructions written for them. We have an obligation to document our estate for any event where our assistance 
would be impossible.
