The mission of FortyTwoBinary is two-fold. First, and foremost we strive to produce world-class software 
that is practical, useful, economical, performant, available, reliable, etc. (more to come) and devoid of 
bugs. Secondly, we wish to provide projects for those having that same mission.

Producing world-class software requires a team of talented individuals, each contributing their own 
insight, experience, skills, and effort into the current software product(s).
