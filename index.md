When we try to do everything ourselves, we are generally not very organized. We all do have our own method, system, strategy,
process, policy, or protocol for handling our responsibilities. For us, it is just a simple way of getting a thing done. Our
everyday responsibilities do not have to be written down. We inherently know what we need to do. We do it our way. We do it the
right way. We keep these instructions in our own mind and we only tend to write things down that are difficult to remember. Once
we memorize the important stuff, we do not need anything but ourself. Or do we?
