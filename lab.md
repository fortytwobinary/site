The FortyTwoBinary lab was created as an experiment to test the capability of a privately hosted Raspberry Pi cluster (5 nodes) on a home network (dynamic IP?). Now that the cluster is active we've been documenting everything and hosting this documentation on the cluster. You can read about our efforts at this link <a href="https://apache.fortytwobinary.com" target="_blank">https://apache.fortytwobinary.com</a> .

The current goal is to maintain a scalable platform for development and testing of components that will make up the VirtualYou system overall. Take a look and if you're interested in our startup, let us know. Remember, if you share an interest with us, we can share more too.
